# IlusionOfCubeWave

##Background😁
I have always hated math 😣😣, and I felt like I somehow need to reduce that wrath for it, as its a nice subject and it doesnt deserve my eye roll.
So, I deceided to learn math by making fun projects that are not only a feast to the eyes, but teach me a lot of concept of how animations work. 
And there u go, I made a cubeWave.💁‍♀️💁‍♀️😋

## Here's my version of illusion of a CubeWave👀👀:

## How I did it👾👾👾:
I used p5.js which is a javascript library used for animations and graphics.
I did the coding in the p5.js editor, which is available for free.
